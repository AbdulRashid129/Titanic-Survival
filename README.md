# Titanic Survival Prediction
This project builds a classification model to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic using logistic regression. The dataset includes information such as age, gender, class, and fare, which are used to determine the likelihood of survival.

Project Objectives
- Explore and clean the Titanic dataset
- Perform feature engineering
- Train a logistic regression model
- Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance
- Gain insights into key survival factors

Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas & NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib & Seaborn

Key Steps
- Handle missing values and convert categorical features
- Use logistic regression for binary classification
- Evaluate model with accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC curve
- Analyze feature importance

Results
The model achieved an accuracy of **80%** on the test set. **Gender** and **Passenger Class (Pclass)** were found to be the most significant predictors of survival.
